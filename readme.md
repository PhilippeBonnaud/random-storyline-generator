## About

This is a very simple random generator. It will output different variables that could be used to serve as constraints for creating a story or just for the fun of it.

Most of the values used are from the wiki TV tropes.

## TODO

* add buttons to the result section allowing either regeneration with same criteria or return to main page for mofications
* add explanation of each categories on mouse hover
* link relevant data to TV trope articles
* overall styling
